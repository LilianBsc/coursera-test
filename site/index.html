    <p class="quote">
        Voila! In view humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of fate. 
        This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the “vox populi” now vacant, vanished.
        However, this valorous visitation of a bygone vexation stands vivified, and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin, 
        van guarding vice and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition.
        The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta, held as a votive not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one 
        day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous.
        Verily this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose, so let me simply add that it’s my very good honour to meet you 
        and you may call me V.
